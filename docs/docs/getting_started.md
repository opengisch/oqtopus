# Getting Started

oQtopus is designed to deploy PostgreSQL modules managed by [pum](https://github.com/opengisch/pum/) along with a QGIS project and plugin. 
It can be installed either as a QGIS plugin or as a standalone Python executable.

## oQtopus as a QGIS Plugin

### Installation

#### ðŸ”§ Prerequisites (Mainly python packages)
> [!WARNING] 
> On Windows, QGIS installation doesn't provide the necessary Python libraries yet.
> You need to install psycopg and pydantic using pip.

Before anything, you should check for these python packages to be available in your QGIS environment :

On windows start the osgeo4w shell and run following command :
```
pip install --upgrade pum pirogue pydantic psycopg
```

#### Install the Module management plugin

1. Run your QGIS (>=) 3.40 (LTR)
2. Under the extensions manager / parameters -> tick the experimental plugins

3. Search for `oQtopus` with a `Q` like `QGIS` and install the latest release

### Download a module
In the `Module selection` box:
1. Launch the plugin
2. Select the desired module (ie. `TWW` and the version (ie. `2025.0.1rc2`))
3. Wait for the assests being downloaded

### Create or prepare the host database
In the `Database connection` box, you can either:
* Choose a defined PG Service for an existing database
* `...` Create an empty database and create the corresponding PG service
* `...` Duplicate an existing database

### Install the module
In the previous steps, you selected the module to be installed and defined the destination database.

In the `Module` tab:
* Tick if you want to create and grant roles. Attention, if the module users are not existing in the postgresql server, the installation of the module might fail.
* Tick if you want to install demo data and choose which demo dataset
* **advanced users**: specify advanced installation parameters in the `Parameters` box.
* Click `Install XXXXX`

### Get the projet
In the `Project` tab:
* Click `Install template project` and choose the project destination. The project is initialized with the defined service.
* If the langage setting are properly defined (QGIS local is defined and corresponding translation `.qm` file is existing. Ie. fr_CH and `module_name_fr_CH.qgs`), the project is translated in your langage.

## Install the module plugin
In the `Plugin` tab, you can install the module plugin (ie. TWW plugin). Direct install using the `Install` button is currently not implemented.
* Click `Copy ZIP to directory`
* In QGIS > Extension > Install and manage extension > Install from ZIP
