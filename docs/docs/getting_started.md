# Getting Started

oQtopus is designed to deploy PostgreSQL modules managed by [pum](https://github.com/opengisch/pum/) along with a QGIS project and plugin. 
It can be installed either as a QGIS plugin or as a standalone Python executable.

## oQtopus as a QGIS Plugin

> [!WARNING] 
> On Windows, QGIS installation doesn't provide the necessary Python libraries yet.
> You need to install psycopg and pydantic using pip.

1. In QGIS, open the plugin manager.
3. In the parameters, enable experimental plugins.
4. Search and install `oqtopus`.
